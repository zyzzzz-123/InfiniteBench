If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements after sorting. Ensure that the function handles lists with both odd and even lengths. The function should not use any external libraries or built-in functions like `median` from Python's statistics module. Provide a detailed explanation of the code and its logic in comments.\n\n\n### Answer:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    # First, we sort the list of numbers in ascending order\n    numbers.sort()\n    \n    # Find the length of the list\n    n = len(numbers)\n    \n    # Check if the list has an odd number of elements\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        # If odd, return the middle element\n        return numbers[n // 2]\n    else:\n        # If even, return the average of the two middle elements\n        # Calculate the indices of the two middle elements\n        mid1 = n // 2 - 1\n        mid2 = n // 2\n        # Return their average\n        return (numbers[mid1] + numbers[mid2]) / 2\n\n# Example usage:\n# median_value = calculate_median([1, 3, 3, 6, 6, 9, 12])\n# print(median_value)  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThe `calculate_median` function first sorts the input list of numbers in ascending order. It then checks if the length of the list is odd or even. If it's odd, the function returns the middle element, which is at index `n // 2` (integer division). If the list is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements, which are at indices `n // 2 - 1` and `n // 2`. This approach ensures that the function works for both odd and even-length lists without using any external libraries or built-in functions like `median`.\n\n", "ground_truth": [48.0]}

If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element after sorting the list.

Provide a detailed explanation of the sorting algorithm used and its time complexity.\n\n\n### Answer:\n\nTo calculate the median of a list of numbers, we will implement a simple sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort, which is a comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list. Although not the most efficient for large datasets, it's straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for this task.\n\nHere's the `calculate_median` function with Bubble Sort implemented:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_median(numbers):\n    # Check if the list is empty\n    if not numbers:\n        return None\n\n    # Bubble Sort algorithm\n    n = len(numbers)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element\n            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:\n                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]\n\n    # Find the median\n    if n % 2 == 0:  # Even number of elements\n        return (numbers[n//2 - 1] + numbers[n//2]) / 2\n    else:  # Odd number of elements\n        return numbers[n//2]\n\n# Example usage:\nnumbers = [59, 70, 66, 19, 37, 10, 91, 1, 90, 83, 67, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19, 37, 10, 66, 70, 19", "ground_truth": [46.0]}
