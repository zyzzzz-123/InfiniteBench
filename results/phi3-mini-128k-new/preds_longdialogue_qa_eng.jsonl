Louie is involved in the storyline as someone who has been manipulated or deceived, particularly in relation to the counterfeit money and the attempted kidnapping of Mrs. Baldwin. His role in the story and his interactions with Hildy and Walter suggest that he has been a part of the dramatic events leading up to the marriage and the revelation of the counterfeit money, which is a significant plot point.\n\n\nTherefore, the character that has been replaced with $$MASK$$ is Louie Peluso.", "ground_truth": ["ENDICOTT"]}
